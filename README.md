This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About the project

This movie analyser app has been built with react. Some modules that were used are <br>

<li>react-table</li>
<li>match-sorter</li>
<li>react-toggle</li>

In the budget filter, the filtering is based on the value/money (>= search value).
In others, we're trying to match the substring.

Two themes have been provided for accessibility.

### Please run https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ before starting the app, since proxy has been used to bypass CORS from the client side.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To get the dependencies

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
